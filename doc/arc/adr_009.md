# [ADR_009](../../README.md) Ingesting & storing health information

Date: 11/1

## Status

accepted

## Context

Farmacy foods would eventually like to be able to ingest health information about customers to provide meal recommendations to improve specific health and wellbeing aspects of their customers. 

Handling this data is not an immediate requirement, but should be considered as a future need.

## Decision

Ingesting health information will be handled in the Customer domain. Different types of health data ingestion apis will allow different types of heath data to be ingested, such as:

* Manual customer entry (height/weight)
* Smart-watch data (resting heart rate, oxygen levels)
* 3rd party physical data (blood pressure, cholesterol levels)

Due to HIPAA concerns, this data will be brought in and kept in a separated database from the other customer information. Only the customer info domain will be able to link health information to personal identities. All other components will only be able to access anonymized health data.

## Consequences

By keeping health data separate, it will make it easier for farmacyfoods to control what kinds of customer data certain employees have access to. Customers will be able to have assurances that only certain farmacy foods employees can access their data, while also not limiting farmacyfoods from having other employees available to handle other customer support requests that require handling other data.
