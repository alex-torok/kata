# [ADR_017](../../../README.md) Use queue to update the inventory and external notification

## Status

accepted

## Context

We discussed what should be the mechanism to update inventory and send out notification to actor outside of  the software system. This ADR records the reasoning behind the decision. 

## Decision

We have chosen queue based approach for inventory update . The primarily reason of using a queue to handle incoming inventory update requests are: 
+ The actual updating the inventory will inevitable require some IO operation, that may take long time.
+ Queue can send acknowledgment to the requester as fast as the request comes, so that Inventory does not have to return the results to the clients. 
+ Queue is fault tolerance, it can provide some protection from system outages and failures.
+ Message based communication is flexible, it maximally decouples the sender and receiver, this is important because the FarmacyFood system is expected to handle 3rd party vendor in the future. 

## Consequences
The update to the inventory is not instant, it is sequential according to the order of messages arrival, and inventory database is eventual consistency.
